            <p>At the Biomaterials and Regenerative Medicine Lab, we harness the power of the immune system and biomaterials to advance 
                therapies for various diseases. Nearly every known pathology—from tissue injury and cancer to aging—is influenced by immune 
                function. Our research focuses on engineering biomaterials that can modulate immune responses to promote healing and restore 
                tissue function. We employ cutting-edge biomaterial platforms to construct complex, humanized in vitro disease models for 
                mechanistic discovery and high-throughput drug screening. In parallel, we design biomaterial-based delivery systems and tissue 
                scaffolds to directly modulate immune activity and promote tissue regeneration in vivo. By integrating principles of immunology, 
                materials science, and stem cell biology, we aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms of immune dysfunction and leverage this 
                knowledge to develop next-generation immunotherapies.​</p>
