            <p>Our group is dedicated to uncovering immune
            mechanisms in various disease conditions and
            innovating biomaterial-based immunotherapy for
            tissue injury, cancer, and aging-induced tissue
            degeneration. <br/>
                Toward this goal, we focus on two
            main research directions: <br/>
                (1) We design biomaterials
            with tunable biophysical and biochemical cues to
            directly modulate immune activity and promote
            tissue regeneration. <br/>
                (2) We develop humanized in
            vitro disease models for mechanistic discovery of
            immune crosstalk and high-throughput drug
            screening. By integrating principles of immunology,
            materials science, and stem cell biology, we aim to
            uncover the underlying mechanisms of immune
            dysfunction and leverage this knowledge to
            develop next-generation immunotherapies.​</p>

              <p>Large bone defects do not heal spontaneously and remain a significant clinical
            challenge. Immunomodulatory approaches have emerged as a promising new strategy in
            tissue engineering by harnessing and directing the host immune response to promote
            tissue regeneration. To address this, we designed an immunomodulatory macroporous
            hydrogel material for the regeneration of critical-sized bone defects. Our platform
            integrates innovative strategies including biomimetic material design, tuning of scaffold
            composition, and controlled delivery of immunomodulatory cues to orchestrate a
            regenerative immune environment.​</p>

              <h2>1.1 Cell membrane coating technology</h2>
              <p>Cell membrane (CellMem) coating offers distinct advantages in biomimicry by leveraging the full repertoire of natural 
                  membrane-bound ligands. We pioneered the integration of stem cell-derived membranes onto macroporous hydrogel scaffolds 
                  to achieve localized immunomodulation. These CellMem-coated scaffolds modulated both macrophage and T cell responses, 
                  resulting in complete regeneration of critical-sized craniofacial bone defects. Our ongoing work further explores cell membranes
                  derived from various cell types and their synergistic effects with cell-secreted vesicles to develop therapies for tissue 
                  injury in aging and cancer treatment.​​</p>

              <h2>1.2 Modulating immune-stem cell crosstalk by tuning material composition </h2>
              <p>We developed a macroporous scaffold with tunable ratios of gelatin (Gel) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), 
                  enabling rapid endogenous bone regeneration in a critical-sized defect model, without the need for 
                  exogenous growth factors or transplanted cells. We further harness single-cell sequencing and computational
                  profiling to uncover the mechanisms of immune responses within the bone injury niche in response to varying 
                  material composition. This research has identified novel regenerative immune cell populations and revealed 
                  unique crosstalk patterns orchestrated by implanted scaffolds.</p>

            <h2>2.1 Exosome-laden scaffold as an immune “training camp.”</h2>
              <p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-secreted exosomes exhibit equivalent
immunomodulatory capabilities as live cells, but there remain challenges in the limited
retention of MSC exosomes in the injury niche. To address this issue, we developed
exosome-functionalized fibrous scaffolds that exhibited prolonged exosome retention in
the skin wound area. Inspired by the principles of cancer vaccine development, where
scaffolds served as a “training camp” for immune systems to fight against cancer, this
innovative design synergized fibrous scaffolds with MSC exosomes, enabling the
recruitment and targeted training of the immune system toward regenerative states.​​</p>

              <p>Given the therapeutic MSC secretome in immunomodulation and angiogenesis, we explored how to improve their
therapeutic secretome through cell-material interaction. We engineered topographical patterns of fibrous scaffolds,
which increased anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factor release from MSCs, leading to accelerated healing in the
skin wound. This study provided the evidence of using scaffold topography to potentiate MSC paracrine function.</p>
